/// File overview:
/// Adapts Cotabby's shared suggestion request into the prompting style that works best with Apple's
/// Foundation Models framework.
///
/// Why this file exists:
/// llama.cpp and Apple's on-device model accept the same high-level task, but they respond best
/// to different prompt shapes. The local llama runtime consumes one prompt string directly, while
/// Foundation Models gives us a first-class instructions channel. Keeping that translation here
/// prevents Apple-specific prompt policy from leaking back into `SuggestionCoordinator` or the
/// shared request factory.

    /// Apple documents that instructions have higher priority than the prompt itself, which makes
    /// them the right place to say "this is autocomplete, not chat."
    ///
    /// The framing is deliberately *text continuation*, not *assist the user*. Apple's system model
    /// is chat-tuned, so any second-person/assistant framing pulls it toward greetings and
    /// replies. Apple's WWDC25 prompt-design guidance is to use a positive identity plus a small
    /// number of demonstrations rather than a long list of prohibitions, so the rules here stay
    /// short, positive, and concrete; the two few-shot examples below carry the rest of the
    /// anti-drift signal.
