/// Decides, during decoding, whether the completion accumulated so far should stop generation
/// early, and why.
///
/// The shipping decoder otherwise samples up to a fixed token budget and trims afterward, which lets
/// the model ramble past the point a suggestion is useful. Early stops apply:
///
/// - **Sentence boundary**: the accumulated text ends at a natural sentence end. A short
///   minimum-token guard avoids degenerate instant stops (for example, the model's first token being
///   a lone period). `SentenceBoundaryClassifier` already rejects decimals, abbreviations, and list
///   markers, so this never truncates "e.g.", "3.14", or a numbered "1." mid-thought.
/// - **Scaffolding marker**: the accumulated text contains a chat-template stop marker
///   (`<|im_end|>` and friends). The normalizer already truncates the visible text at the first such
///   marker, so everything generated past it is guaranteed-discarded work; stopping at decode time
///   produces the identical suggestion while skipping the rest of the token budget, exactly in the
///   worst case where the model has drifted into template scaffolding. No minimum-token guard: a
///   marker means the model believes the turn is over, no matter how early it appears.
/// - **Word limit**: handled incrementally in the decode loop via `CompletionWordCounter` before a
///   piece is appended, so this policy stays focused on text-shape stops.
///
/// Both text checks inspect only the already-accumulated string (at most a few hundred characters),
/// so they add no per-token vocabulary work in the decode loop.
