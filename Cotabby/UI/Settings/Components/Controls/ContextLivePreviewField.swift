/// File overview:
/// The Context pane's live-preview field, and the shared identity that lets the real pipeline drive it.
///
/// Cotabby never completes inside its own UI (`FocusTracker` blocks capture whenever Cotabby is the
/// focused app, so completions can never appear in the settings search field, the Extended Context
/// editor, menus, and so on). The live preview is the single sanctioned exception: it is a real,
/// native editable text view, tagged with `ContextLivePreview.accessibilityIdentifier`, and
/// `FocusTracker` lifts its self-capture rule for that one element only. Typing in it is therefore a
/// genuine end-to-end exercise of the production focus -> suggestion -> overlay -> insertion path, the
/// same one every other app gets.
///
/// Because the real overlay renders the gray suggestion at the caret and the real inserter commits it
/// on the accept key, this view renders nothing itself. That is the whole point of the redesign: the
/// previous in-app editor mirrored a SwiftUI binding into an `NSTextView` and reconciled a ghost run
/// inside the editable storage, and that reconciliation raced with live keystrokes and corrupted typed
/// text. Here the `NSTextView` owns its string outright and nothing reaches into it, so typing is fully
/// native.
